            <H4>Big data by itself is just a worthless collection of numbers and characters. To make big data work,
                you need to show how the information is meaningful. Taking a storytelling approach to analytics is one
                way
                to put big data in context.

                One of the analytics vendors that’s well-versed in telling data-driven stories is clearStory Data,
                which develops a Hadoop-based application that lets users explore big-data feeds, find relevant
                insights,
                and share them with others. ClearStory is one of the first Hadoop vendors to use the in-memory Apache
                Spark
                , which drives the harmonization of big, fast-moving data feeds.

                At this week’s Strata + Hadoop World conference, the Menlo Park, California company unveiled a new way
                that
                customers can interact with the application. The new Storyboards feature is designed to make it easier
                to share
                the insights gleaned from ClearStory’s Spark-powered data harmonization engine.

                Instead of sharing just a single big-data storyline in a single dashboard, the new Storyboards mode
                enables
                groups of users to share multiple storylines in an interactive manner. Not only can users see how
                different
                big data sets correlate and compare, they can watch as the story unfolds, similar to scenes unfolding in
                a movie,
                ClearStory Data founder and CEO Sharmila Mulligan.</H4>
